//! Orderly shutdown for the interactive TUI on an externally delivered
//! process signal: SIGINT, SIGTERM, SIGHUP on Unix; the Ctrl+C, console
//! close, and system-shutdown console events on Windows.
//!
//! # Why this exists
//!
//! Nothing on the interactive path (`entrypoint::run_agent` ->
//! `App::run()`) previously registered any of these. A supervisor stop, a
//! bare `kill <pid>`, a container shutdown, or closing the terminal
//! (SIGHUP) hit the OS default disposition: immediate termination, no
//! unwind, no `Drop`, no panic hook. Two things depend on an orderly exit
//! actually running:
//!
//! - `tools::process_registry` tracks background processes (bash
//!   `run_in_background`, `tools::background_tasks`) for cleanup on exit;
//!   its only callers are the panic hook and the path after `app.run()`
//!   returns *normally* (`entrypoint.rs`). A bare signal skips both, so
//!   those children are orphaned permanently.
//! - `session::writer::SessionWriter` buffers up to
//!   `DEFAULT_BATCH_SIZE - 1` entries and flushes on `Drop`. A bare signal
//!   never runs that `Drop`, so `--resume` silently drops the most recent
//!   turns with no error shown.
//!
//! # Ctrl+C-as-keypress is untouched by design
//!
//! While the TUI is running, `crossterm::terminal::enable_raw_mode` clears
//! the tty's `ISIG` termios flag, so the terminal driver stops turning a
//! Ctrl+C *keystroke* into a `SIGINT` at all -- it only ever arrives as the
//! byte `0x03` on the input event stream, handled entirely in-app as
//! "cancel the current turn". The listeners in this module only resolve for
//! signals actually delivered by the OS (`kill(2)`, a supervisor, a
//! disconnecting controlling terminal): raw mode means the keyboard never
//! produces one of those while the app has focus of the tty. So installing
//! these listeners cannot turn an in-app Ctrl+C keypress into a process
//! exit. Outside of raw mode (startup, `init_fallback`, a shell that never
//! entered raw mode), a Ctrl+C now exits through the orderly path below
//! instead of the OS default -- a strict improvement, not a UX change to
//! the in-app cancel behavior.
//!
//! # Composition with PR #3094 (signal-safe crash handler)
//!
//! #3094 installs an async-signal-safe `SIGSEGV`/`SIGBUS` handler that
//! restores the terminal from *signal-handler context* (precomputed
//! escapes, no heap allocation, no async runtime) because a hard crash can
//! occur at any point, including inside the allocator or the runtime. That
//! is a fundamentally different mechanism from this module: SIGINT/TERM/HUP
//! are not crashes, we are already inside the tokio runtime when they
//! arrive, and normal async code (allocation, `.await`, `eprintln!`) is
//! safe to run in response to them. This module does not touch, duplicate,
//! or need `crash_handler.rs`; the two are complementary (hard-crash vs.
//! orderly-termination) and can be reviewed/merged independently.
//!
//! # Shutdown sequence
//!
//! 1. Register all signal streams before constructing `App`, then race
//!    `App::run` against the monitor receiver with
//!    `tokio::select!`.
//! 2. If the signal wins, arm the second-signal escape hatch (see
//!    "Re-entrancy" below), then drop the pinned `app.run()` future. That
//!    is ordinary `Future` cancellation of the interactive loop, not panic
//!    unwinding, so it happens the same way whether or not this crate's
//!    `panic = "abort"` release profile is in effect. The future only
//!    borrows `App` (`run` takes `&mut self`), so dropping it does not yet
//!    drop the App itself.
//! 3. Call and await `App::signal_shutdown_teardown()`: cancel the per-tool
//!    cancellation tokens, await their task handles so foreground child
//!    processes are killed and reaped, and emit the notifier teardown the
//!    normal exit path runs (clear tab progress, restore the saved terminal
//!    title).
//! 4. On a blocking thread (`tokio::task::spawn_blocking`, so the sync
//!    work cannot starve the escape-hatch task on this worker): drop the
//!    App, which cascades into `SessionWriter::drop` and flushes buffered
//!    entries (`session/writer.rs`); call `cleanup_background_processes()`
//!    (the process registry is a free-standing global
//!    `std::sync::LazyLock<RwLock<..>>` in `tools::process_registry`, not
//!    owned by `App`); and call `terminal::restore()` (also a free
//!    function on a process-global tty handle, `terminal::setup::TTY`, so
//!    it is safe regardless of what state `App::run` left the terminal in).
//! 5. Return `Ok(signal.exit_code())` -- the conventional `128 + signo` --
//!    so the caller's existing exit-code and worktree-teardown plumbing in
//!    `run_cli` still runs exactly as it does for a normal exit. Shutdown
//!    by signal does not skip worktree cleanup.
//!
//! # Re-entrancy
//!
//! Step 4 above is synchronous once the race resolves, so it runs on a
//! blocking thread rather than an async worker. If any of it were ever to
//! hang (a wedged child process, a blocked write to a dead tty), an
//! impatient operator sending a second signal needs an escape hatch that
//! does not depend on this task being polled again. [`ShutdownMonitor`]
//! owns the registered streams on a detached task created before `App`
//! construction. After forwarding the first signal it keeps waiting for a
//! second and can force-exit even if app construction or cleanup is stuck.
//! If the TUI returns normally, dropping the monitor receiver leaves that
//! task alive through the caller's synchronous worktree cleanup; a signal
//! during that interval restores the terminal and exits immediately.
//!
//! # Cancellation safety
//!
//! Racing `app.run()` inside `select!` means whatever the interactive loop
//! was in the middle of (an in-flight model request, a pending tool
//! execution, a partially read keystroke) is abandoned mid-flight when the
//! signal wins -- the same "no further forward progress" outcome as a hard
//! kill, just reached through a controlled Rust drop instead of `SIGKILL`.
//! The durability guarantee this module adds is narrower and specific:
//! `SessionWriter::flush` only ever writes whole, already-serialized
//! entries, so cancellation cannot produce a torn write to the session
//! file. Any background tokio tasks the app may have spawned and detached
//! (not tracked by `tools::process_registry`, e.g. a streaming response
//! task) are not explicitly joined or aborted here; they are torn down by
//! the process exit that follows shortly after `run_cli` receives this
//! function's return value, the same way they already are on the existing
//! normal-completion path.
