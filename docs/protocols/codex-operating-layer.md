# Codex Operating Layer

This protocol keeps the long-horizon Codex work honest. Maestro should not only
route to Codex app-server; it should behave like an audited operating layer for
durable EvalOps agents across TypeScript, Rust, web, headless, and live
operator workflows.

The next horizon is the Codex Mesh: upstream Codex app-server collaboration
primitives become Platform-owned work graph, delegation, remote-runner, and
GitOps runtime state instead of transient local UI events.

The executable evidence map lives at
[`codex-operating-layer.json`](./codex-operating-layer.json). Run it with:

```bash
npm run check:codex-operating-layer
```

## Far-Horizon Success Criteria

- Codex works from a fresh install without silently losing native safety-parser
  behavior.
- Operators can sign in with ChatGPT, inspect status, and run Codex doctor from
  the Maestro CLI.
- TypeScript can run Codex app-server threads with dynamic tools, dynamic-tool
  lifecycle events, approval-gated dynamic callbacks, token usage, subagent
  lifecycle events, and streaming output. Dynamic callback lifecycle events keep
  Platform `toolExecutionId` and `approvalRequestId` joins, including denied
  governance callbacks, so hosted timelines, approvals, and ToolExecution
  governance can be audited without exposing those IDs to the model-facing tool
  result payload.
- Hosted Codex subagent collaboration records Platform AgentRun work items so
  parent/child work can be inspected, resumed, scored, and restored remotely.
  Spawned children also become Platform agent-registry delegations so ownership,
  routing capability, resolution, and evidence refs survive remote execution;
  spawn only opens the delegation, while wait/close or child restore failure
  resolves it. TS and Rust both normalize child run ids and persist subagent
  edge lifecycle state, so spawn/send/resume/wait/close edges survive drain and
  restore. Hosted local task progress also projects todo, background-task, and
  swarm state into deterministic Platform AgentRuntime work items/steps so
  multi-agent coordination is visible without copying raw logs, env, diffs, or
  teammate output.
- Rust can expose the same Codex models through the control plane, bridge
  Codex headless runs, run the hosted remote-runner entrypoint, stream
  SSE/WebSocket events, handle approval requests, and preserve sandbox policy.
- Durable thread metadata covers goals and memory linkage instead of treating
  Codex runs as disposable one-off calls.
- Eval telemetry and trajectory fixtures can score approvals, child runs,
  recovery, and tool execution without scraping human-readable logs.
- Live verification exercises real Codex inference through the installed CLI,
  not only local mocks.

## Operator Verification Path

Use the fast gate while editing:

```bash
npm run check:codex-operating-layer
npm run check:codex-parity
```

Use the runtime gate before merging changes that affect Codex execution:

```bash
npm test -- test/agent/codex-app-server.test.ts test/agent/provider-transport-provider-tools.test.ts test/codex/app-server-client.test.ts test/codex/compatibility.test.ts test/cli/codex-command.test.ts test/scripts/codex-operating-layer-conformance.test.ts test/scripts/codex-parity-conformance.test.ts test/server/runtime-app-server-ws.test.ts test/server/hosted-runner-drain.test.ts test/headless/runtime-conformance.test.ts
npm run tui-rs:test -- hosted_runner
npm run smoke:codex-app-server-live
```

The live Codex smoke is intentionally stricter than a token-presence check. It
uses JSONL output to verify that the final assistant message exactly matches the
token, fails on loop-detector warnings, runs the real inference from an isolated
temporary workspace, and enforces bounded dynamic tool calls with
`MAESTRO_CODEX_LIVE_SMOKE_MAX_TOTAL_TOOL_CALLS` and
`MAESTRO_CODEX_LIVE_SMOKE_MAX_IDENTICAL_TOOL_CALLS`. It also runs real Codex
subagent spawn/wait inference and requires `codexWorkGraph` evidence on both
`codex.subagent.spawnAgent` and `codex.subagent.wait`; the versioned
`codex-subagent-workgraph-v1.json` fixture pins the full
spawn/send/resume/wait/close lifecycle for TypeScript and Rust conformance, and
the remote-runner drain tests require lifecycle-edge continuity without copying
child prompts into manifest metadata.

`maestro run inspect <session-id> --json` also emits a `durability` summary for
the local restore path. The summary is intentionally compact and redacted: it
proves the session file was found, reconstruction produced timeline and
AgentRuntime ledger entries, replay was deterministic, resume-summary and
memory-hash continuity are present when saved, and the dry-run promotion plan has
a stable idempotency key. Published replay smokes assert that summary so release
evidence does not stop at "the CLI printed text."

## Completion Bar

The operating-layer goal is not complete just because this manifest passes. This
manifest is the prompt-to-artifact checklist that prevents drift. Completion
still requires a fresh audit showing every area is covered by real code, tests,
operator documentation, PR review, merge state, and live evidence from the
current environment.
